\begin{abstract}
% Rewrite this
One oft-neglected problem in modern machine learning is that of causality: which events \emph{cause} which others? What is the effect of interventions? Ideally, learning these concepts requires experimental interaction with the environment to observe the results of interventions, but this is not always possible. We show that the gradients of a predictive model trained on static data can correspond to causal concepts. We also introduce a dataset consisting of simulated car crashes from the video game Beam.NG, on which we demonstrate that this gradient method can be used to infer something about the cause of the car crashes.
\end{abstract}

\noindent %Most modern machine learning is concerned purely with statistical prediction: given a fixed dataset, predict the labels. 

Causality refers to the underlying process generating a set of observations, rather than just the observations themselves. Many inferences can be drawn from the statistical analysis of observations, but these inferences break down when faced with changes to the underlying generating process known as \emph{interventions}, which can alter the probability distribution of the resulting observations in a way that is not predictable from a purely observational model. % Need to explain and cite much of this terminology

One potential problem is...
